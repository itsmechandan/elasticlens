# ElasticLens (Basic) — Pricing, Discount & Marketing Impact Simulator

ElasticLens is a basic, end-to-end analytics project that mimics a real client engagement:
- Generate business-like raw data (with intentional issues)
- Clean it
- Build a single modeling dataset
- Understand trends (before modeling)
- Build a price sensitivity model (simple, explainable)
- Build a demand prediction model (better forecasting)
- Run what-if scenarios (price/discount/marketing)
- Package into a Streamlit app

This version is intentionally **basic** so the workflow is easy to follow and easy to explain in interviews.

## What problem this project solves (simple words)

**Question:**  
“If we change price, discount, or marketing spend, what happens to units sold, revenue, and profit?”

**Outputs you get:**
- A clear price sensitivity number (how demand changes when price changes)
- A demand prediction model (forecast units)
- Scenario table that shows impact on units / revenue / profit
- A small Streamlit app to demonstrate results
